## Sample Data

The repository includes a small `sample_backup/` folder for testing.
Structure of the sample backup:

```
sample_backup/
â”œâ”€â”€ Photos/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IMG_20250101.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IMG-20250101-WA0001.txt  # duplicate
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IMG_20250102.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IMG_20250102 (1).txt     # duplicate
â”œâ”€â”€ Documents/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Report.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Report (1).txt           # duplicate
â”œâ”€â”€ Videos/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Meeting.txt
