## WhatsApp Backup Duplicate Cleaner

A simple Python project to detect and remove **duplicate files** in WhatsApp or mobile backup folders.  
Duplicates often happen when the same photo, video, or document is saved multiple times (like `IMG_20250101.jpg` and `IMG-20250101-WA0001.jpg`).

## Features
- Scans folders for duplicate files
- Detects duplicates based on **file content**, not just file names
- Works for Photos, Videos, Documents, and more
- Includes a **sample dataset** (`sample_backup/`) for testing

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/whatsapp-duplicate-cleaner.git
   cd whatsapp-duplicate-cleaner
````

2. Make sure Python is installed (Python 3.7+ recommended)

3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python duplicate_cleaner.py
   ```

4. Check the console output for detected duplicate files.

## ðŸ“‚ Sample Backup Folder

The repo includes a small `sample_backup/` folder with example files:

```
sample_backup/
â”œâ”€â”€ Photos/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IMG_20250101.txt          (content: "Holiday photo")
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IMG-20250101-WA0001.txt   (duplicate)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IMG_20250102.txt          (content: "Office party")
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IMG_20250102 (1).txt      (duplicate)
â”œâ”€â”€ Documents/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Report.txt                (content: "Annual Report 2025")
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Report (1).txt            (duplicate)
â”œâ”€â”€ Videos/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Meeting.txt               (content: "Project meeting recording")
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Meeting (copy).txt        (duplicate)
```

## Notes

* Only reads the content of files to check duplicates
* Does not delete files automatically (you can add that functionality later)
* Works on any folder structure, not just WhatsApp backups
